### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Benjamin Fransson, a software developer based in Gothenburg, Sweden. When I find time I like to do fun coding challanges such as [adventofcode.com/](https://adventofcode.com/), play games or start another project that will never be finished.

I have a burning passion for automation and problem solving, programming is my way of bringing that to life. I also have an interest for new technologies and new ways to implement old technologies. I like the thought of automating normal everyday activities such as grocery shopping.
