### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Benjamin Fransson, a software developer based in Gothenburg, Sweden. When I find time I like to do fun coding challanges such as [adventofcode.com/](https://adventofcode.com/), play games or start another project that will never be finished.

I have a burning passion for automation and problem solving, programming is my way of bringing that to life. I also have an interest for new technologies and new ways to implement old technologies. I like the thought of automating normal everyday activities such as grocery shopping.

ðŸ”­ I currently have a certain interest for: Hardware controlled by NodeJS

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning KeystoneJS with NextJS 

Feel free to contact me at any time for any reason, you can find my email adress on the left side here on my github profile-page ðŸ˜Š
